/// Internal, task‑local authorization context used by proxy configurations.
///
/// ``AuthorizationContext`` is an internal actor that carries the current access token for
/// a single logical unit of work, typically one agent turn. It is not meant to be used
/// directly by applications. Provider transports set this context using a `@TaskLocal`
/// value so request builders can attach the token to outbound requests.
///
/// Proxy transports read this context on each request.
/// If a request returns `401 Unauthorized` and a `refreshToken` closure is available, the
/// adapter may invoke it to obtain a new token and retry once.
